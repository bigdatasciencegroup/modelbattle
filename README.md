# experiments

## firebase config

replace the values in `src/firebaseConfig.js` with those for your own firebase project.

## scripts

in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

runs the app in the development mode.<br />
open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `yarn eject`

**note: this is a one-way operation. once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
